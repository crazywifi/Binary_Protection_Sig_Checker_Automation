# Binary_Protection_Sig_Checker_Automation

I have developed an automation script for testing binary protection and signature issues. Previously, we had to open the terminal and enter commands, which involved copying paths, and it was a bit irritating for me.
Now, with this script, all you need to do is execute the batch file and paste the installable directory path. Both test cases will be performed automatically by this script, and you will receive the results in the same folder under the name "output."

It might be helpful for someone.
